# secure-key-exchange
building a secure key exchange mechanism using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm:

Generate a large prime number p and a generator g. Both p and g should be publicly known and agreed upon by both parties.

Alice and Bob agree on a secret random number a and b respectively, which they keep private.

Alice calculates g^a mod p and sends the result to Bob. Bob calculates g^b mod p and sends the result to Alice.

Alice and Bob now have a shared secret key, which can be calculated as (g^b mod p)^a mod p by Alice and (g^a mod p)^b mod p by Bob.

The shared key can now be used for symmetric encryption, such as with AES, to secure their communication.

To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, both parties should authenticate each other's public keys, using digital signatures or a trusted third-party.

Additionally, to further improve security, both parties can periodically change their secret numbers a and b, and generate a new shared key using the same prime number and generator.

Finally, it's important to use large prime numbers and generators to make the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm resistant to brute-force attacks.
